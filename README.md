# Research-Scraper

## Simple Introduction

Google Scholar has become a quasi-standard tool for listing publications associated with individual researchers worldwide. However, Google Scholar (and similar tools), does not provide the functionality to capture publications associated with a group of researchers, such as formal or informal research groups (ADAC, IMA, ASAP). As it is often important to research groups to capture their groups’ publications in a coherent listing, e.g., on their website, a tool which can scrape information from individuals’ Google Scholar pages, look for tags such as group names, and then generate purpose-built listings would be of considerable use.
 
## Key requirements:

  + Provide a UI which enables an administrator to select individual research profiles and to add them to a group.
  + Provide functionality to enable the administrator to provide search tags such as research group names
  + Retrieve publication information from Google Scholar or similar
  + Parse PDFs of publications to look for search tags
  + Generate result databases of group publications
  + Provide various output methods for the databases, incl. a structured HTML page which can be included in a website
